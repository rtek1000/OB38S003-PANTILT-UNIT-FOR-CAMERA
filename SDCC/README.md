This project is from Eclipse IDE, but it is compiled by SDCC. Currently I haven't found a plugin to create SDCC projects in Eclipse IDE. To get around this, I made use of script that executes other programs.

- Previously I had already used SDCC, for STM8S003 microcontroller, you can see the project for the W1209 thermostat board [here](https://github.com/rtek1000/W1209-firmware-modified/tree/master/W1209/W1209-firmware-Eclipse/w1209-firmware-modified-eclipse).
